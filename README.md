# React ToDo List with Tailwind CSS

A modern and responsive ToDo list application built with React. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It also includes a feature to delete all tasks at once. The app uses React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing state and side effects, React Router (`useNavigate`, `useLocation`) for navigation, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
